Hi! I am Gezi, who is pursuing a Ph.D. in Genetics from Yale University. 

This blog is to have my tech notes stored as document that I can share with my team and collaborators. BUT anyone interested is welcome! If you have any question, please leave a comment or reach me at geziw81889@gmail.com. 

Let's make progress together.
